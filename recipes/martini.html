    <h1>Martini</h1>

    <h2>
      A cocktail made with gin and vermouth, and garnished with an olive or a
      lemon twist. Over the years, the martini has become one of the best-known
      mixed alcoholic beverages. A popular variation, the vodka martini, uses
      vodka instead of gin for the cocktail's base spirit.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This dry martini is made with five parts gin to one part dry vermouth,
      which gives the drink a lovely aromatic quality. If you prefer the
      cocktail even drier, you can lower the proportion of vermouth to ¼
      ounce—but don’t leave it out altogether or your drink won’t be a martini
      at all (just a glass of cold gin with an olive). That said, there’s no
      wrong way to enjoy this drink. Over the years people have come up with a
      long list of martini cocktail variations that are all delicious: You can
      use equal parts gin and vermouth for a Fifty-Fifty, use a combination of
      dry and sweet vermouths for a “perfect martini,” add some olive juice to
      the mix for a dirty martini, or swap the olive for a cocktail onion to
      make a Gibson.
