    <h1>Brownies</h1>
    <img src="../images/brownies.jpeg" width="50%" />
    <h2>
      A chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may
      be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but
      not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      lasagna: 1. Make the brownies: Melt the butter on the stove, then remove
      from heat and add the remaining wet ingredients. Beat in the dry
      ingredients. Spread the batter in the pan and bake. 2. Frost the brownies:
      Stir the frosting ingredients together until well-combined, then frost the
      brownies while they are still warm. Cut into squares when cool.

    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flower</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an
        8-inch square pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan. Remove from heat, and stir in
        sugar, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in 1/3 cup cocoa, flour, salt,
        and baking powder. Spread batter into prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to
        pull away from the sides of the pan, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool
        briefly before frosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the frosting: Combine softened butter, confectioners' sugar, 3
        tablespoons cocoa, honey, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl. Stir
        until smooth. Frost brownies while they are still warm.
