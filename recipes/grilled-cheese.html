    <h1>Grilled Cheese</h1>

    <h2>
      A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one or
      more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as
      butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread
      browns and the cheese melts.
    </h2>

      This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully
      crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend
      of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it
      tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull. Other delicious
      options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.

      This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use
      sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese
      with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is
      sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will
      quickly fall apart.

    <ul>
      <li>4 slices white bread</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 slice Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side
        of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet;
        add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and
        place butter-side up on top of cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking
        until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter,
        and slice of cheese.
